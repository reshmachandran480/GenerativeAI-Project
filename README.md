## Support Ticket Categorization with Generative AI
### Overview
In today's fast-paced business environment, organizations are increasingly reliant on customer feedback to drive product development and enhance customer satisfaction. Efficiently managing support tickets is crucial for maintaining customer loyalty and driving business growth. This project aims to develop a Generative AI application using a Large Language Model to automate the classification and processing of support tickets.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to create an application that can:

Automatically categorize support tickets based on their content.
Assign priority levels to tickets.
Suggest estimated resolution times for each ticket.
Store the results in a structured DataFrame for further analysis and action.
