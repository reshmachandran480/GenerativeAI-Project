# Automating Support Ticket Categorization with Generative AI

### Business Context
In today's dynamic business landscape, organizations recognize the pivotal role customer feedback plays in shaping product and service trajectories. Automating support ticket categorization is crucial for swiftly responding to customer input, fostering enhanced experiences, and catalyzing growth. As a Product Manager or Analyst, staying attuned to customer needs is a strategic imperative.

### Objective
This project aims to develop a Generative AI application using a Large Language Model to automate the classification and processing of support tickets. The application predicts ticket categories, assigns priority, suggests resolution times, generates sentiment-based responses, and stores results in a structured DataFrame.

### Key Features
- **Data Overview:** Provides insights into the structure and content of the dataset.
- **Model Building:** Utilizes a pre-trained model from Hugging Face and defines functions to generate responses.
- **Tasks 1-6:** Progressively categorizes and processes support tickets, from basic categorization to generating draft responses.
- **Model Output Analysis:** Performs univariate analysis on the structured output DataFrame to derive insights.
- **Actionable Insights and Recommendations:** Shares observations, insights, and recommendations for businesses adopting such a solution.

### Notebook Quality
- **Structure and Flow:** Well-commented code guides users through each step of the process.
- **Comprehensive Business Context:** Emphasizes the importance of automated support ticket categorization in today's business landscape.
- **Clear Objective:** States the objective of developing a Generative AI application for ticket processing.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provides recommendations for pilot implementation, user training, change management, and continuous evaluation and optimization.

### Conclusion
This notebook offers a comprehensive guide to automating support ticket categorization with Generative AI. It's designed to assist Product Managers or Analysts in efficiently processing customer feedback, enhancing experiences, and driving organizational growth.
